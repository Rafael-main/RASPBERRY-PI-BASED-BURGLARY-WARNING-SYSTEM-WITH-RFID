setup raspi with these commands:
open terminal and make sure raspi is connected to internet
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
1. sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
2. sudo pip3 install spidev
3. sudo pip3 install mfrc522
4. Now, enable I2C and SPI communication. Because the LCD screen and RFID module required these communication methods. If you want to know whether I2C is working or not, run the following code on the terminal. Then, we can see the I2C address.
5. enter command : i2cdetect -y 1
6.
