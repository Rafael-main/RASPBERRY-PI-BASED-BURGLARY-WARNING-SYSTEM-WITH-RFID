## Background of the Study
At an early age, people tended to use manual labor for establishing security in their
households. Most of their security is manually operated which is more labor intensive
especially when it comes to monitoring. Nowadays, people tend to rely on technology for
securing a safe environment in places that are more prone to accidents, especially burglary.
Through understanding the basic concept of technology, people can provide various security
systems which involve electronic applications and automation.
According to (Sentencing Council , n.d.) states that burglary refers to a crime that involves
forced invasion or trespassing to a property with malicious intent like stealing, attempts to
harm, and other unlawful activities. These activities will result in numerous crimes such as
theft and robbery which there most commonly committed crimes in the Philippines (Crime in
the Philippines, 2021). But how did these guys do burglary? According to (Iboshi, 2019),
they send an investigation team for sending 86 questionnaires to the burglary-related inmates.
One of the questions asked how they broke into a home or apartment and most of them are
respond to force entry through the door or windows. To keep these incidents prevented,
security must be adhering among the entry ways.
Making a burglary warning device that uses Raspberry Pi as the foundation will help lessen
the cost while meeting the performance levels found in common alarm systems. Whenever
the device detects force entry in doors and windows, the said device will execute the
commands which are triggering the alarm while sending message through SMS API

## Statement of the Problem
Security is the most important variable to provide a secure place among households and
establishments. To heighten security in this area, establishing a warning system is the best
action, especially in burglary incidents. So the researcher came up with the idea of making a
Raspberry Pi-based burglary warning device that uses RFID to heighten the security details
of the said device

## Objectives of the Study:
This study focuses on the following:
1. To be able to identify probable burglary activities in a residence or building.
2. To produce an alert and notify owners when suspicious movements are detected within
their houses.
3. To create a low-cost prototype of a burglary alarm and notification system.
